# merge_sort_cpp
merge and sort algorithm implementation in c++
I wrote this implementation as a training to refresh my C++ skills. In this implementation, the division step is more of conceptual and
not part of the code, I'm not sure, but I like to think this is more effecient as it reduces the memory required, and eliminates the need
to transfer elements between temporary arrays :)
